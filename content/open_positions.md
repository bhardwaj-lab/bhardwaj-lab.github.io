## PhD and Postdoc Positions

We currently do not have an open PhD or postdoc position available immediately. However, we are always excited to hear from interesting candidates. If you are looking for a PhD/postdoc position at the intersection of genomics and computational biology, feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:v.bhardwaj@uu.nl) 6-12 months in advance, so we can consider you for any upcoming position.

## Internships

For students enrolled in a master's program (or looking for an Erasmus+ internship), we have possible spots for an internship/ thesis project opening every 4-6 months in our lab. Please look at our [internships page](https://vblab.org/internships/) for more information.
