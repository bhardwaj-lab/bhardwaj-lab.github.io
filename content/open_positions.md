## PhD and Postdoc Positions

We currently do not have an open PhD or postdoc position available immediately. However, we are always excited to hear from interesting candidates. If you are looking for a PhD/postdoc position at the intersection of genomics and computational biology, feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:v.bhardwaj@uu.nl) 6-12 months in advance, so we can consider you for any upcoming position.


## Master's internships

Are you a student enrolled in a master's program in (applied) data science / computer science etc. and interested in gaining experience in bioinformatics? Or are you enrolled in a bioinformatics-related program and would like to do a research project related to computational genomics? We have **multiple projects suitable for a 6 to 9 months master's internship!** The exact project can be tailored to your background and interest. For students enrolled in molecular life sciences / genetics / biomedical sciences programs, we have opportunities for specific mixed (wet+dry lab) projects. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:v.bhardwaj@uu.nl) for further information.
