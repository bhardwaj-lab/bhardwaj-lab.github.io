We are excited to [release our new preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.27.605424v1) describing our Single-cell informatics (sincei) toolkit.

Due to their unique exploration challenges, the data from emerging singlecell epigenomics protocols can be difficult to work with. We present sincei, a toolkit for exploring sc(epi)genomics data directly from BAM files, using bash one-liners (or via a python API). Read [the documentation here](https://sincei.readthedocs.io/), or look at [our GitHub repo](https://github.com/bhardwaj-lab/sincei) for details on how to use sincei for your project.

Going beyond standard scRNAseq or scATACseq workflows, sincei provides flexible signal aggregation, QC and dimensionality reduction methods that can work with several single-cell epigenomic assays. Have a look at our preprint for details.

Kudos to [Soufiane Mourragui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soufianemourragui/) for his help in building sincei.
