We are excited to [release our new preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.23.614335v1) describing a single-cell multiomics analysis of histone modifications and gene expression during zebrafish development. By applying our newly developed experimental protocol called TChIC, we show how histone modifications and transcription are correlated during development and how a lineage-specific activation and silencing of key developmental genes is achieved. Also, we apply an explainable machine learning model to identify active/repressive roles of transcription factors based on their chromatin signature.
