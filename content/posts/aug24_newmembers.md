Over the past months, our lab has grown to 3 new members:
 - Faik Usul and Maria Karaboeva: Master student from UU Bioinformatics (BiBC) program, who will work with us on single-cell transcriptomic data analysis.
 - Fernando Sancho Gomez: New PhD student, who joins us after finishing his master's in Bioinformatics from KU Leuven. Fernando will work on multiple projects in line with the lab's core research theme, including developing new computational methods for single-cell epigenomics and multi-omics analysis.

Welcome, Faik, Maria and Fernando!
