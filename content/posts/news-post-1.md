I am excited to announce that Bhardwaj lab would open its doors at the biology department of the Utrecht University from the 1st of Feb 2024. I am appointed as an assistant professor at the Institute of Biodynamics and Biocomplexity, where our lab will work closely with the divisions of Bioinformatics, Developmental Biology, and Genome Biology/Epigenetics.

## Projects

Following the [general research interest](https://vblab.org/) of our lab, our projects shall focus on the following areas:

  - **Data Engineering**: Developing optimal preprocessing workflows for data from in-house and public single-cell omics technologies.
  - **Data Science**: Building statistical/machine learning models for the prediction of a cellâ€™s gene expression state using its chromatin state.
  - **Software Development**: Developing user-friendly bioinformatic tools for the exploration of quantitative (single-cell/single-molecule) genomics data.
  - **Data-driven Biology**:  Integrating in-house and publicly available data and applying statistical analysis to study the role of transcription factor-chromatin interactions in defining cell fates during embryonic development.

## Open positions

We have possibilities for **PhD and master projects** within our group, and in future we plan to expand. If the topic of our research excites you, feel free to check out our open positions.
