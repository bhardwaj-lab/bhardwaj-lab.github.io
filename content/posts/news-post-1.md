I am excited to announce that Bhardwaj lab would open its doors at the biology department of the Utrecht University from the 1st of Feb 2024. I am appointed as an assistant professor at the Institute of Biodynamics and Biocomplexity, where our lab will work closely with the divisions of Bioinformatics, Developmental Biology, and Genome Biology/Epigenetics.

## PhD position

For students with a master's degree, and a background in Bioinformatics, or other quantitative disciplines, we have an opportunity for a **4-year, fully funded PhD position!** More information about the position will soon follow, along with an official advertisement. But students who are interested in the **computational epigenomics of single-cells**, are encouraged to [contact me](https://vblab.org/contact/) for further information.


## Master's internships

Are you a student enrolled in a master's program in (applied) data science / computer science etc. and interested in gaining experience in bioinformatics? Or are you enrolled in a bioinformatics/life science program and would like to do a research project related to computational epigenomics? We have **multiple projects suitable for a 6 to 9 months master's internship!** The exact project can be tailored to your background and interest. Feel free to [contact me](https://vblab.org/contact/) for further information.
