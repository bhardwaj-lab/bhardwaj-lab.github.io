I am excited to announce that Bhardwaj lab would open its doors at the biology department of the Utrecht University from the 1st of Feb 2024. I am appointed as an assistant professor at the Institute of Biodynamics and Biocomplexity, where our lab will work closely with the divisions of Bioinformatics, Developmental Biology, and Genome Biology/Epigenetics.

## Projects

Following the [general research interest](https://vblab.org/) of our lab, our projects shall focus on the following areas:

  - **Data Engineering**: Developing optimal preprocessing workflows for data from in-house and public single-cell omics technologies.
  - **Data Science**: Building statistical/machine learning models for the prediction of a cellâ€™s gene expression state using its chromatin state.
  - **Software Development**: Developing user-friendly bioinformatic tools for the exploration of quantitative (single-cell/single-molecule) genomics data.
  - **Data-driven Biology**:  Integrating in-house and publicly available data and applying statistical analysis to study the role of transcription factor-chromatin interactions in defining cell fates during embryonic development.


## PhD position

For students with a master's degree, and a background in Bioinformatics, or other quantitative disciplines, we have an opportunity for a **4-year, fully funded PhD position!** An official advertisement, along with information about the position will soon follow. But students who are interested in the **computational epigenomics of single-cells** are encouraged to [contact me](https://vblab.org/contact/) for further information.


## Master's internships

Are you a student enrolled in a master's program in (applied) data science / computer science etc. and interested in gaining experience in bioinformatics? Or are you enrolled in a bioinformatics-related program and would like to do a research project related to computational epigenomics? We have **multiple projects suitable for a 6 to 9 months master's internship!** The exact project can be tailored to your background and interest. Feel free to [contact me](https://vblab.org/contact/) for further information.
